 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run 
        as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more <b>efficient</b> 
        because it completes tasks faster for larger input sizes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to execute completely. 
        It includes both the space required by the input data and any auxiliary space used by the algorithm. 
        Typically, Space Complexity is represented using Big O notation, such as O(n), to indicate how memory usage scales 
        with input size.
