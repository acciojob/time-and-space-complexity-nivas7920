 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <!-- First Paragraph -->
  <p>
    Time complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of input increases. 
    It helps determine how <strong>efficient</strong> an algorithm is in terms of execution time.
  </p>

  <!-- Second Paragraph -->
  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. 
    It helps us understand how efficiently memory is utilized while solving a problem, 
    and it can often be expressed as O(n) in Big O notation.
